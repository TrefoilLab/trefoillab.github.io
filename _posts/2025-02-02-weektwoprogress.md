This week, we came up with many game ideas that incorporate trefoil knots. This included: an obby (obstacle course), a mariocart-like game, and a dungeon crawler.
In order to incorporate these ideas, we needed hollow out the trefoil knot, allowing players to traverse the inside. With some extra math we were able to create
the newly hollowed out trefoil knot.

Hollow Trefoil:

We also added a lot of different variables to allow us to easily manipulate the trefoil such as radius, sizing, num points, etc:

Unfortunately, the animations for the links level was giving us more trouble than it was worth. Rather than spending too many weeks trying to come up with new physics just for one level, we changed the way the links level works.

Instead of hardcoding the character movement and animation playing, we made use of Roblox's engine to make the links work in a conveyor style.

This week we decided on a major overhaul. We decided to change the game into an open world RPG. Players will be able to explore a newly made open world, completing multiple different trefoil/knot/links based quests.

We currently plan on making 6 different levels, and will utilize the levels that we have currently already made. It will also include a quest and inventory tracker.

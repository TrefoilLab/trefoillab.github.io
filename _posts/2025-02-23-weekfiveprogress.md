This week, we had a new idea of a level that we could implement. It involves sliding along 
links, and then jumping to new links to reach the end of the level. While on the link,
you can collect coins for a higher score! 

Here is a drawing of the idea made by our sponsor:

For this week, we did researching on similar games to see how we could implement this idea.
For now, we created a basic sliding animation that'll be used in the level:

This week we started work on the obbies. Our first obby incorporates a procedurally generated
course that's randomized everytime the game is started. The goal of the course is to touch every
block and reach the end. When you fall you're teleported back to the starting point!

Our next obby has a similar goal, but is less forgiving. Rather than having the time to plan jumps,
like in the first obby, you only have a few seconds to jump to the next point before you fall!

We also created a UI to easily teleport players to the levels:
